 PART A — Research Questions (ShortAnswers)
What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
Better reasoning: 
Gemini 3 Pro can handle complex, multi-step tasks more accurately.
Larger context window:
 Can process more text, images, and other inputs simultaneously.
Enhanced safety: Stronger protections against misleading prompts or misuse.
Multimodal capabilities: Improved understanding of text, images, videos, and spatial reasoning.
Deep Think mode: Optimized for research-heavy or detailed problem-solving.
2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Agentic coding: 
Gemini 3 agents can plan tasks, write code, and use tools autonomously.
Google Antigravity: 
New development platform allowing agents access to code editors, terminal, and browser for automation.
Structured outputs: 
Supports schema-based outputs to coordinate tasks and streamline automation.
Interactive app creation:
 Users can provide natural language prompts, and Gemini 3 generates working code or UI automatically.
3)How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
Visual reasoning: 
Understands images not just as pixels but for their meaning and structure.
Spatial reasoning:
 Can process object locations and movements—useful for robotics or screen-based agents.
Video reasoning: 
Handles long video contexts and extracts important information
Large context window: 
Combines text, images, and videos in a single coherent understanding.
4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Google Antigravity: 
An agent-first development IDE where agents can autonomously interact with code editor, terminal, and browser.
Gemini API (new version): 
Supports structured and schema-based outputs, usable with Google AI Studio or Vertex AI.
